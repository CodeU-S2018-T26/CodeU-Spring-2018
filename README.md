# JRAMM Chat
## Google CodeU 2018

Access the online version [here](https://projecteam26.appspot.com).

Our chat app has a few interesting features, namely
**Notifications**, an **Activity Feed**,
the ability to **Send Images**,
and **Custom Emojis.**


* **Notifications:** Using the Firebase API, our app
pushes notifications to the user's browser whenever a new message
is sent in a conversation they are subscribed to. For demonstration
purposes, you will receive notifications even for messages that you
send. This way you can actually see notifications in action! Note:
notifications only work if you're using a secure connection (https).

* **Activity Feed:** The Activity Feed allows the user
to see what's going on in the conversations that they follow. You can
when new users join the chat and send messages.

* **Images and Custom Emojis:** When composing a message,
the user has the option to attach and send any image. That image is
then saved with the message in DataStore. Additionally, you can create
custom emojis by uploading a photo and giving it a "shortcode" name.
Custom emojis are sent by typing the :shortcode: surrounded by the ':'
character. You can also make your text **BOLD** or
_italics_ or `code` using standard markdown syntax.
We also make links automatically clickable, and you can send standard
emojis by using the shortcodes [here](https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/).

Some things to try:
* Enable notifications! You can do this after logging in. Make sure you use https!
* Follow some chats!
* Make your text **BOLD**
* Send a üçî
* Paste in a link! (make sure to include the http://)
* Share your favorite meme or picture of a puppy.
* Upload a custom emoji! Make sure to give it a good name :)

## Here are some instructions for running our app locally.

### Step 1: Download Java

Check whether you already have Java installed by opening a console and typing:

```
javac -version
```

If this prints out a version number, then you already have Java and can skip to
step 2. If the version number is less than `javac_1.8`, then you have an old
version of Java and should probably upgrade by following these instructions.

Download the JDK (not the JRE) from [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk9-downloads-3848520.html).

Retry the `javac -version` command **in a new console window** to check the
installation. If you still don't see a version number, then update your `PATH`
environment variable so it contains Java's `bin` directory. Follow [these
directions](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml) to do so.

### Step 2: Download Maven

This project uses [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) to compile and run our
code. Maven also manages dependencies, runs the dev server, and deploys to App
Engine.

Download Maven from [here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi). Unzip the
folder wherever you want.

Make sure you have a `JAVA_HOME` environment variable that points to your Java
installation, and then add Maven's `bin` directory to your `PATH` environment
variable. Instructions for both can be found
[here](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).

Open a console window and execute `mvn -v` to confirm that Maven is correctly
installed.

### Step 3: Install Git

This project uses [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for source version control and
[GitHub](https://github.com/) to host our repository.

Download Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Make sure Git is on your `PATH` by executing this command:

```
git --version
```

If you don't see a version number, then make sure Git is on your `PATH`.

### Step 4: Setup your repository

Follow the instructions in the first project to get your repository setup.

### Step 5: Run a development server

In order to test changes locally, you'll want to run the server locally, on your
own computer.

To do this, open a console to your `codeu_project_2018` directory and execute this command:

```
mvn clean appengine:devserver
```

This tells Maven to clean (delete old compiled files) and then run a local
App Engine server.

You should now be able to use a local version of the chat app by opening your
browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### Step 6: Make a change!

- Bring down the existing server by pressing `ctrl+c` in the console running the
App Engine devserver.
- Modify a `.java` or `.jsp` file. (Try updating the homepage by editing the
`index.jsp` file.)
- Bring the devserver back up by executing `mvn clean appengine:devserver`
again.
- Refresh your browser to see your changes!
